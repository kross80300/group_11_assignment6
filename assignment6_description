Our assignment 6 is meant to provide a graphical simulation of galaxies. It randomly generates galaxies
and more can be generated by clicking anywhere on the game window. The particles that make up the galaxies
are meant to follow the rules of gravity as if there was something in the center, and orbit in a circle.

Particle Class(Anunay):
  The particle class keeps track of all the different variables for each particle and applies
  gravitational forces
Galaxy Class(Katie):
  The Galaxy class generates the particles and keeps lists of particles together as one object and 
  calculates the math for applying forces to each particle
Game1 Class(Spencer):
  Runs the simulation, keeps track of user mouse clicks and generates new galaxies, and finally draws
  galaxies as the particles move.

Doing all the calculations and getting the classes working together was the hardest part, especially
since this project had more calculations than most.
